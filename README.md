# Morse Code Translator

## Outline

Create a Morse Code Translator that works both ways. It was up to us how this functioned. I chose to use a textarea with a click event on the button to translate and render on the screen.

For the first time we had to introduce our own testing by adding atleast 2 test blocks. This provided a great challenge as my initial code didn't include any functions. At this point we haven't covered DOM testing so I had to do several refactors. For the testing we used Jest.
