## Design Goals / Approach

- I wanted 2 seperate input boxes. This would make a clear difference between English -> Morse & Vice Versa.
- Needed to have an area to desribe instructions. For eg using "ENTER" to seperate Morse words.

## Future Goals

- Have a list of accepted characters.
- Add more characters to be accepted.
- Have a section of what was just translated.
- Put all files in seperate folders and create testing for each file.
